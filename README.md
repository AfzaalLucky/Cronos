## Features

* Parse cron expressions comprising five or six fields. See [Cron format](#cron-format).
* Calculate next execution in zoned time and UTC.
* Support extended format with non-standard characters: `?`, `L`, `W`, `#`.
* Handle the transition from standard time to daylight saving time and vice versa.

## Installation

TBD

## Usage

### Calculate next execution in zoned time

```csharp
var expression = CronExpression.Parse("0 30 * * * *");
var easternTimeZone = TimeZoneInfo.FindSystemTimeZoneById("Eastern Standard Time");

var nextTime = expression.Next(DateTime.Now, DateTime.MaxValue, easternTimeZone));
```

### Calculate next execution in UTC time

```csharp
var expression = CronExpression.Parse("* * * * * *");

var nextTime = expression.Next(DateTime.Now, DateTime.MaxValue, TimeZoneInfo.Utc);
```

### Daylight Saving Time

Cronos handles the transition from standard time (ST) to Daylight saving time (DST). 

**Setting the clocks forward**

If next execution falls on invalid time when the clocks jump forward then next execution will shift to next valid time. See example:

```csharp
var expression = CronExpression.Parse("0 30 2 * * *");
var easternTimeZone = TimeZoneInfo.FindSystemTimeZoneById("Eastern Standard Time");

// 2016-03-13 - the day when DST starts in Eastern time zone. The clocks jump from 1:59 am ST to 3:00 am DST. 
// So duration from 2:00 am to 2:59 am is invalid.

var startTime = new DateTime(2016, 03, 13, 01, 50, 00);

// Should be scheduled to 2:30 am ST but that time is invalid. Next valid time is 3:00 am DST.
var nextExecution = expression.Next(startTime, DateTime.MaxValue, easternTimeZone);

Console.WriteLine("Next execution at " + nextExecution);

// Next execution at 2016-03-13 03:00:00 AM -04:00
```

**Setting the clocks backward**

When DST ends you set the clocks backward so you have duration which repeats twice. If you are in USA the duration was e.g. 2016/11/06 from 1:00 am to 1:59 am. If next execution falls on this duration behavior depends on cron expression:

* Cron expression describes certain time of a day, e.g. `"0 30 1 * * ?"` - 1:30 am every day, or `"0 0,45 1,2 * * ?"` - 1:00 am, 1:45 am, 2:00 am, 2:45 am every day. In this case each cron job will be scheduled only before clock shifts. Reason is when you describe certain time of day you mean that it should be scheduled once a day regardless whether there is clock shifts in that day.

    ```csharp
var expression = CronExpression.Parse("0 30 1 * * ?");
var easternTimeZone = TimeZoneInfo.FindSystemTimeZoneById("Eastern Standard Time");

var startTime = new DateTime(2016, 11, 06, 00, 59, 00);

var nextTime = expression.Next(startTime, DateTime.MaxValue, easternTimeZone);
Console.WriteLine("Next execution at " + nextExecution);

nextTime = expression.Next(nextExecution?.AddSeconds(1));
Console.WriteLine("Next execution at " + nextExecution);

// Next execution at 2016-03-13 01:30:00 AM -04:00
// Next execution at 2016-03-13 02:30:00 AM -05:00
    ```

* Cron expression describes secondly, minutely or hourly job, e.g. `"0 30 * * * ?"`, `"0 * 1 * * ?"`, `"0,5 */10 * * * ?"`. In this case each cron job will be scheduled before and after clock shifts.

    ```csharp
var expression = CronExpression.Parse("0 30 * * * ?");
var easternTimeZone = TimeZoneInfo.FindSystemTimeZoneById("Eastern Standard Time");

var startTime = new DateTime(2016, 11, 06, 00, 59, 00);

var nextTime = expression.Next(startTime, DateTime.MaxValue, easternTimeZone);
Console.WriteLine("Next execution at " + nextExecution);

nextTime = expression.Next(nextExecution?.AddSeconds(1));
Console.WriteLine("Next execution at " + nextExecution);

nextTime = expression.Next(nextExecution?.AddSeconds(1));
Console.WriteLine("Next execution at " + nextExecution);

// Next execution at 2016-11-06 01:30:00 AM -04:00
// Next execution at 2016-11-06 01:30:00 AM -05:00
// Next execution at 2016-11-06 02:30:00 AM -05:00
    ```

### Cron format

Cronos uses a cron expression comprising five or six fields separated by white space that represents a set of times, normally as a schedule to execute some routine.

| Field        | Required | Allowed values  | Allowed special charecters | Comment                  |
|--------------|----------|-----------------|----------------------------|--------------------------|
| Seconds      | No       | 0-59            | * , - /                    |                          |
| Minutes      | Yes      | 0-59            | * , - /                    |                          |
| Hours        | Yes      | 0-23            | * , - /                    |                          |
| Day of month | Yes      | 1-31            | * , - / ? L W              |                          |
| Month        | Yes      | 1-12 or JAN-DEC | * , - /                    |                          |
| Day of week  | Yes      | 0-7 or SUN-SAT  | * , - / ? L #              | 0 and 7 standing for SUN |

**Star `*`**

`*` means any value. Used to select all values within a field. For example, `*` in the hour field means "every hour":

| Expression    | Description                          |
|---------------|--------------------------------------|
| `* * * * * *` | Every second                         |
| `* * * * *`   | Every minute                         |
| `30 3 * * *`  | At 3:30 AM every day                 |
| `0  0 1 * *`  | At midnight, on day 1 of every month |

**Comma `,`**

Commas are used to separate items of a list.

| Expression        | Description                           |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `15,45 * * * * *` | Every minute at 15 and 45 seconds     |
| `* * * * SAT,SUN` | Every minute on saturdays and sundays |

**Hyphens `-`**

Hyphens define ranges. For example, 03-05 indicates every month between march and may, inclusive.

| Expression        | Description                                |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `0-30 1 * * *`    | Every minute between 01:05 AM and 01:10 AM |
| `0 0 * * MON-FRI` | At 00:00, Monday through Friday            |

**L**

`L` stands for "last". When used in the day-of-week field, it allows you to specify constructs such as "the last Friday" (`5L`) of a given month. In the day-of-month field, it specifies the last day of the month.
| Expression    | Description                                          |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `0 0 L * *`   | At 00:00 AM on the last day of the month             |
| `0 0 L-1 * *` | At 00:00 AM the day before the last day of the month |
| `0 0 * * 1L`  | At 00:00 AM on the last monday of the month          |

**W**

`W` character is allowed for the day-of-month field. This character is used to specify the weekday (Monday-Friday) nearest the given day. As an example, if you were to specify `15W` as the value for the day-of-month field, the meaning is: "the nearest weekday to the 15th of the month." So, if the 15th is a Saturday, `Next` returns Friday the 14th. If the 15th is a Sunday, `Next` returns Monday the 16th. If the 15th is a Tuesday, then `Next` returns Tuesday the 15th. However, if you specify "1W" as the value for day-of-month, and the 1st is a Saturday, `Next` returns the 3rd, as it does not 'jump' over the boundary of a month's days. The 'W' character can be specified only when the day-of-month is a single day, not a range or list of days.

| Expression        | Description                                              |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `0 0 1W * *`      | At 00:00 AM, on the first weekday of every month         |
| `0 0 10W * *`     | At 00:00 AM on the weekday nearest day 10 of every month |

**#**

`#` is allowed for the day-of-week field, and must be followed by a number between one and five. It allows you to specify constructs such as "the second Friday" of a given month. 

| Expression        | Description                                              |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `0 0 * * 6#3`     | At 00:00 AM on the third Friday of the month             |
| `0 0 * * 1#1`     | At 00:00 AM on the first Monday of the month             |
| `0 0 * 1 1#1`     | At 00:00 AM on the first Monday of the January           |

**?**

`?` means "no specific value". Useful when you need to specify something in one of the two fields in which the character is allowed, but not the other. For example, if I want to set a particular day of the month (say, the 10th), but donâ€™t care what day of the week that happens to be, I would put "10" in the day-of-month field, and "?" in the day-of-week field. See the examples below for clarification. 

**/**

Slashes can be combined with ranges to specify step values. 

| Expression        | Description                                                                                |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `*/5 * * * * *`   | Every 5 seconds                                                                            |
| `0 1/5 * * *`     | Every 5 hours, starting at 01:00                                                           |
| `*/30 */6 * * *`  | Every 30 minutes, every 6 hours: at 00:00, 00:30, 06:00, 06:30, 12:00, 12:30, 18:00, 18:30 |
| `0 0  15/2 * *`   | At 00:00, every 2 days, starting on day 15 of the month                                    |
| `0 0 * 2/3 *`     | At 00:00, every 3 months, February through December                                        |
| `0 0 * * 1/2`     | At 00:00, every 2 days of the week, starting on Monday                                     |
