# Cronos

## Build status

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/v6cq97gdg87j7utl/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/odinserj/cronos/branch/master)

## Features

* Parse cron expressions comprising five or six fields.
* Calculate next execution in zoned time and UTC.
* Support extended format with non-standard characters: ?, L, W, #.
* Handle the transition from standard time to daylight saving time and vice versa.

## Installation

TBD

## Near-term plans

* Remove dependency from NodaTime lib.

## Usage

### Calculate next execution in zoned time

```csharp
var expression = CronExpression.Parse("0 30 * * * *");
var etc = DateTimeZoneProviders.Bcl.GetZoneOrNull("Eastern Standard Time");

var nextTime = expression.Next(SystemClock.Instance.Now.InZone(etc));
```

### Calculate next execution in UTC time

```csharp
var expression = CronExpression.Parse("0 30 * * * *");

var nextTime = expression.Next(SystemClock.Instance.Now.InUtc());
```

### Daylight Saving Time

Cronos handles the transition from standard time (ST) to Daylight saving time (DST). 

**Setting the clocks forward**

If next execution falls on invalid time when the clocks jump forward then next execution will shift to next valid time. See example:

```csharp
var expression = CronExpression.Parse("0 30 2 * * *");
var est = DateTimeZoneProviders.Bcl.GetZoneOrNull("Eastern Standard Time");

// 2016-03-13 - the day when DST starts in Eastern time zone. The clocks jump from 1:59 am ST to 3:00 am DST. 
// So duration from 2:00 am to 2:59 am is invalid.

var startTime = new LocalDateTime(2016, 03, 13, 01, 50, 00).InZoneStrictly(est);

// Should be scheduled to 2:30 am ST but that time is invalid. Next valid time is 3:00 am DST.
var nextExecution = expression.Next(startTime);

Console.WriteLine("Next execution at " + nextExecution);

// Next execution at 2016-03-13 03:00:00 AM -04:00
```

**Setting the clocks backward**

When DST ends you set the clocks backward so you have duration which repeats twice. If you are in USA the duration was e.g. 2016/11/06 from 1:00 am to 1:59 am. If next execution falls on this duration behavior depends on cron expression:

* Cron expression describes certain time of a day, e.g. `"0 30 1 * * ?"` - 1:30 am every day, or `"0 0,45 1,2 * * ?"` - 1:00 am, 1:45 am, 2:00 am, 2:45 am every day. In this case each cron job will be scheduled only before clock shifts. Reason is when you describe certain time of day you mean that it should be scheduled once a day regardless whether there is clock shifts in that day.

    ```csharp
var expression = CronExpression.Parse("0 30 1 * * ?");
var est = DateTimeZoneProviders.Bcl.GetZoneOrNull("Eastern Standard Time");

var startTime = new LocalDateTime(2016, 11, 06, 00, 59, 00).InZoneStrictly(est);

var nextExecution = expression.Next(startTime);
Console.WriteLine("Next execution at " + nextExecution);

nextExecution = expression.Next(nextExecution?.Plus(Duration.FromSeconds(1));
Console.WriteLine("Next execution at " + nextExecution);

// Next execution at 2016-03-13 01:30:00 AM -04:00
// Next execution at 2016-03-13 02:30:00 AM -05:00
    ```

* Cron expression describes secondly, minutely or hourly job, e.g. `"0 30 * * * ?"`, `"0 * 1 * * ?"`, `"0,5 */10 * * * ?"`. In this case each cron job will be scheduled before and after clock shifts.

    ```csharp
var expression = CronExpression.Parse("0 30 * * * ?");
var est = DateTimeZoneProviders.Bcl.GetZoneOrNull("Eastern Standard Time");

var startTime = new LocalDateTime(2016, 11, 06, 00, 59, 00).InZoneStrictly(est);

var nextExecution = expression.Next(startTime);
Console.WriteLine("Next execution at " + nextExecution);

nextExecution = expression.Next(nextExecution?.Plus(Duration.FromSeconds(1));
Console.WriteLine("Next execution at " + nextExecution);

nextExecution = expression.Next(nextExecution?.Plus(Duration.FromSeconds(1));
Console.WriteLine("Next execution at " + nextExecution);

// Next execution at 2016-11-06 01:30:00 AM -04:00
// Next execution at 2016-11-06 01:30:00 AM -05:00
// Next execution at 2016-11-06 02:30:00 AM -05:00
    ```


### Cron format

Cronos uses a cron expression comprising six or seven fields separated by white space that represents a set of times, normally as a schedule to execute some routine.

| Field        | Required | Allowed values  | Allowed special charecters | Comment                  |
|--------------|----------|-----------------|----------------------------|--------------------------|
| Seconds      | No       | 0-59            | * , - /                    |                          |
| Minutes      | Yes      | 0-59            | * , - /                    |                          |
| Hours        | Yes      | 0-23            | * , - /                    |                          |
| Day of month | Yes      | 1-31            | * , - / ? L W              |                          |
| Month        | Yes      | 1-12 or JAN-DEC | * , - /                    |                          |
| Day of week  | Yes      | 0-7 or SUN-SAT  | * , - / ? L #              | 0 and 7 standing for SUN |

*
:  "All values". Used to select all values within a field. For example, '*'' in the hour field means "every hour".

**,**
:  Commas are used to separate items of a list. For example, using "MON,WED,FRI" in the 5th field (day of week) means Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.

**-**
:  Hyphens define ranges. For example, 04-06 indicates every month between april and june, inclusive.

**L**
:  'L' stands for "last". When used in the day-of-week field, it allows you to specify constructs such as "the last Friday" ("5L") of a given month. In the day-of-month field, it specifies the last day of the month.

**W**
:  The 'W' character is allowed for the day-of-month field. This character is used to specify the weekday (Monday-Friday) nearest the given day. As an example, if you were to specify "15W" as the value for the day-of-month field, the meaning is: "the nearest weekday to the 15th of the month." So, if the 15th is a Saturday, the trigger fires on Friday the 14th. If the 15th is a Sunday, the trigger fires on Monday the 16th. If the 15th is a Tuesday, then it fires on Tuesday the 15th. However, if you specify "1W" as the value for day-of-month, and the 1st is a Saturday, the trigger fires on Monday the 3rd, as it does not 'jump' over the boundary of a month's days. The 'W' character can be specified only when the day-of-month is a single day, not a range or list of days.

**#**
:  '#' is allowed for the day-of-week field, and must be followed by a number between one and five. It allows you to specify constructs such as "the second Friday" of a given month. For example, entering "6#3" in the day-of-week field corresponds to the third Friday of every month.

**?**
:  "No specific value". Useful when you need to specify something in one of the two fields in which the character is allowed, but not the other. For example, if I want my trigger to fire on a particular day of the month (say, the 10th), but donâ€™t care what day of the week that happens to be, I would put "10" in the day-of-month field, and "?" in the day-of-week field. See the examples below for clarification. 

**/**
:  Slashes can be combined with ranges to specify step values. For example, */5 in the minutes field indicates every 5 minutes. It is shorthand for the more verbose form 5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50,55,00.
